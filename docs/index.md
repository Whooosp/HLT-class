## Welcome to Varin Sikand's HLT Portfolio

Hi, my name is Varin, and this is a showcase of some NLP projects I've done as part of CS 4395 at UTD. NLP is a really interesting subset of Machine Learning and something that I'm personally passionate about, and I hope that this portfolio reflects that.

### Portfolio Contents
