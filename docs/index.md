## Welcome to Varin Sikand's HLT Portfolio

Hi, my name is Varin, and this is a showcase of some NLP projects I've done as part of CS 4395 at UTD. NLP is a really interesting subset of Machine Learning and something that I'm personally passionate about, and I hope that this portfolio reflects that.

### Portfolio Contents

1. Overview of NLP
2. [Text Processing with Python](https://github.com/Whooosp/HLT-class/tree/main/HW1) - Basic I/O, text processing, and OOP using Python
