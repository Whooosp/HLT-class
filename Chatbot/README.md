# Chatbot Project
See report for description

## Run instructions:
### Install dependencies:
pip -m install sqlite3 unicodedata pandas torch date_extractor flask nltk transformers sklearn

### Run application:
python app.py

After running the above command from the terminal, the models will be installed
and then once the localhost url appears at the bottom, click
on that to launch the web app on your browser. The models will take a while
to load, so don't worry, it's still running.

You must enter a username first and then can type 'logout'
at any time to log yourself out. Go to your terminal and press
Ctrl+C in order to stop the local server. Be sure to type logout
first otherwise your model won't save.
