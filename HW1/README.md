# Portfolio Assignment 1: Text Processing with Python

This assignment explores basic I/O, class creation, and text processing
using default Python libraries. It showcases regex usage to filter
text entries, pickle files for dictionary storage, and basic OOP
within python to store data as objects with error checking

## Run instructions:
Once downloaded, navigate to the base (HW1) folder and run the 
following command within your cmd prompt or terminal.

python ./Homework1_vss180000.py ./data/data.csv

## Strengths and weaknesses of Python for text processing
This project has reinforced my belief that python has multiple
easy-to-use libraries and methods to make text processing simple
within a file. This, alongside the power of list comprehension,
creates a very simple file that is able to do very powerful text
processing (something that would take 4-5 lines within Java or C++
takes 1 line in Python).
This does, however, introduce a sort of black box as all of these
functions and sometimes even default keywords (like using "with"
to open a file) do an entire task all on their own, which limits
how much fine-grain tuning we can do with the processing within
each individual step.

## Learning/Review outcomes
I use python pretty often, but I've never heard of a pickle file
before today, and it seems like a very painless way to output
a dictionary as a file compared to other methods (mainly Pandas).
Besides that, I found the review of list comprehension (especially
when automatically formatting the phone number) to be helpful as
I've been out of practice recently when it comes to Pythonic
programming.
